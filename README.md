Meet J.A.R.V.I.S, a browser-based voice assistant built with vanilla JavaScript. Inspired by Iron Man’s legendary AI, this project responds to your voice commands, opens websites, tells you the time and date, cracks jokes, gives programming tips, and more — all with speech synthesis for a real assistant feel.
